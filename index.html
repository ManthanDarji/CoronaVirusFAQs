            <p>
                Government of India is taking all necessary steps to ensure that we are prepared well to face the
                challenge and threat posed by the growing pandemic of COVID 19 â€“ the Corona Virus. With active
                support of the people of India, we have been able to contain the spread of the Virus in our country.
                The most important factor in preventing the spread of the Virus locally is to empower the citizens
                with the right information and taking precautions as per the advisories being issued by Ministry of
                Health & Family Welfare.

                <p> Q: What are the symptoms of the coronavirus disease?</p>
                <p> A: The most common symptoms are fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In
                    more severe cases infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and even death.
                    The period within which the symptoms would appear is 2-14 days.</p>

                <p>
                    Q: What is the recovery time for the coronavirus disease?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A: Using available preliminary data, the median time from onset to clinical recovery for mild cases
                    is approximately 2 weeks and is 3-6 weeks for patients with severe or critical disease.

                <p>
                    Q: How long does the coronavirus last on surfaces?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A: It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to
                    behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary
                    information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days.
